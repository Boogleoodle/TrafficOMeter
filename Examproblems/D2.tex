\section{Writing a proposal}
\subsection*{Proposition}
Consider that you are writing a proposal to your client, then it is beneficial if the client has given you little information as it will force you to visit the client and get more domain knowledge.  
\subsection*{Reason}
A visit to the costumer is a good idea if she/he has not given you any background information about why she/he needs the system. Then you can get a clearer view of why she/he needs that system
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
D, the proposition is wrong but the reason is a correct statement.
\subsection*{Motivation}
The reason is correct as visiting the client often increases the domain knowledge. Even if it is good to visit the client, it is NOT beneficial if they have given you so little information that it forces you to do so.

\section{Quality Requirements}
\subsection*{Proposition}
Correctness is a very important quality factor for systems operating in high risk situations, such as in outer space.
\subsection*{Reason}
Correctness is the measure of how accurately the system performs tasks and delivers information.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
C - The proposition is true, but the reason is false.
\subsection*{Motivation}
When operating in high risk environments it is vital that there are no errors in the system, considering it’s a situation of life and death. Correctness is however not a measurement of how accurately a system performs tasks, but rather a measurement of how many errors it contains.

\section{Quality Requirements}
\subsection*{Proposition}
The different breakpoints (utility, differentiation, saturation) in the Quper-model are based on the current market expectations.
\subsection*{Reason}
The competing products are placed in the model as a reference
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
B: Both the proposition and the reason are correct statements, BUT the reason does not explain the proposition.
\subsection*{Motivation}
The breakpoints are based on market expectation and not directly linked to competing products, they are linked to what is acceptable in the current marked. The competing products are also used in the Quper-model but they have their own dots.

\section{Validation}
\subsection*{Proposition}
It is not necessary for developers and clients to review the tasks.
\subsection*{Reason}
Tasks are only there for providing context to the requirements.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
E, both the proposition and the reason are false.
\subsection*{Motivation}
The people writing the specification might have missed requirements that emerges when reviewing the tasks. Tasks are not only for providing context but are also requirements themselves (task requirements).

\section{Checking and Validation}
\subsection*{Proposition}
The CRUD-matrix is used to find missing quality requirements
\subsection*{Reason}
The CRUD-matrix helps to check the requirement specification for inconsistencies 
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
D: The proposition is false, but the reason is a true statement.
\subsection*{Motivation}
The CRUD-matrix checks for consistencies in the functional context. Which means that it does nothing for quality requirements

%MDRE, PRIO & RP: 2 problems
\section{Market Driven Requirements Engineering}
\subsection*{Proposition}
Considering the alfa/beta model of MDRE selection qualtiy. Alfa requirements are high quality requirements which should selected.
\subsection*{Reason}
When doing MDRE, it can be useful if the development organization can collaborate together with the marketing department.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
B, both reason and proposition are correct but the reason does not explain the proposition.
\subsection*{Motivation}
The alfa requirements are the "golden grains" from the MDRE process as expressed in the text. And it is true that the marketing department can be an asset when doing MDRE as they typically know more about the market and the potential buyers. But the two statements are not correlated.
\subsection*{Reference}
Primarily MDRE article sect 13.3.1 and 13.2.2.

\section{Release Planning}
\subsection*{Proposition}
Release planning is best done with the science of release planning.
\subsection*{Reason}
The art of release planning is biased since it relies only on human judgement and therefore should not be a part of the release planning.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
E - Both the proposition and the reason are false.
\subsection*{Motivation}
After reading the article I consider the best way to be release planning using the hybrid approach, where you start with the science of release planning to get a couple of possible good release plans, but then use the art of release planning to choose and make minor alterations to get the most appropriate one. People in the project are good for the judgement calls that an algorithm cannot handle and therefore the art of science should also be included in the release planning.

\section{MDRE}
\subsection*{Proposition}
MDRE doesn't apply well to companies with an undefined process.
\subsection*{Reason}
If key persons leave the company, key knowledge might also leave.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
A - both the proposition and the reason are true
\subsection*{Motivation}
Companies without a defined process take a significant risk if key persons leave the organization, since they lack the necessary documentation and structure. In times of downsizing or rapid expansion it is very difficult to install a repeatable proces

% AGRE & INTDEP, 1 problem
\section{Agile Requirements Engineering}
\subsection*{Proposition}
Non functional requirements, such as security and scalability, have a tendency to be neglected when using agile RE. 
\subsection*{Reason}
When working with agile RE the prioritization is often based on the product owner's business value, which often is defined as high usability or more features.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
A, the proposition is correct and the reason explains why.
\subsection*{Motivation}
The article on AGRE brings up the neglect of non functional requires as a challenge with AGRE. It also says that the increased interaction with the product owner leads to prioritization decisions to be based on business value.

AGRE article p. 64

\section{INTDEP}
\subsection*{Proposition}
Requirements interdependencies is important when in comes to release planning and they are often identified explicitly.
\subsection*{Reason}
The amount of requirement interdependencies makes them easy to identify and the idientification become less complex as the numbers increase.
\subsection*{Correct Answer}
E - Both the Proposition and the Reason are false
\subsection*{Motivation}
Requirements interdependencies has an important role in release planning, but they are NOT often identified explicitly because it becomes harder to identify them and the complexity grows as the numbers increase.
