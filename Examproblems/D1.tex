\section{Problem 1}
\subsection{Proposition}
Focus groups are used mainly towards the end of a project in order to validate requirements together with the stakeholders.
\subsection{Reason}
Focus groups are similar to brainstorming sessions where various stakeholders participate.
\subsection{Correct Answer}
D, The proposition is wrong but the reason is a correct statement.
\subsection{Motivation}
Focus groups are used early in the project, often to generate new ideas. And not for validating requirements late in a project. Typically end users and other stakeholders take part in the focus groups.
