  \section{About this document}
  This document describes the process used, techniques chosen and why, learning
outcomes and a personal statement from each team member on their individual
contribution.
  \section{Methods/techniques}
  %Description of the techniques
  %Why we have chosen these methods, what did we want from the different 
  \subsection{Brainstorming}
Brainstorming is a technique where the participants toss around words or ideas
that they have. In a typical brainstorming session there is a high tolerance and
no idea or thought is discarded or neglected. Brainstorming can also be used
frequently throughout the project.
    \subsubsection{Application}
We used brainstorming in the beginning of the project to put the idea in to
a more concrete form. Our brainstorming sessions have benn like ordinary
discussions and not always in a structured way.
    \subsubsection{Why chosen}
Brainstorming is a good method to use in the beginning of a project to get
started. It is a easy to use method that does not require a lot of preparations or
materials. It is quite fast and the result is direct. Another reason we have used
is that it does not require much preparation or documentation. Just a couple
of people from the project group can brainstorm for 10 minutes on a topic and
then share with the rest of the group what they came up with.

    \subsubsection{Outcome}
    Other than a more conrete idea, the brainstorming also yielded some require-
ments for the system, such as that it should consist of both an app and a widget.
It also helped us to decide on the idea for the project in which we are clients,
Boogle Calender.

    \subsection{Stakeholder analysis}
 This method is used to identify the people or organizations who are needed
to ensure the success for the project. It is important not only to identify the
stakeholders but also to find their interests and goals with the project. It can
be of good help to have a set of questions you want answer to when you do the
stakeholder analysis.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Who are the stakeholders?
      \item What goals do they see for the system?
      \item Why would they like to contribute?
      \item What risks and costs do they see?
      \item What kind of solutions and suppliers do they see?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Application}
 We combined brainstorming and stakeholder analysis to answer the questions
above. This was done mostly within the group but we also discussed with our
clients and with our supervisor.
    \subsubsection{Why chosen}
    Identifying the stakeholders in the beginning of the project will allow us to elicit
more requirements early on. By knowing the stakeholders we can divide the
requirements in to certain groups, which makes the specification and validation
easier.
    \subsubsection{Outcome}
We came to the insight for whom we are really making the system. This led to
a meeting with our costumers in which we realized that the government should
be included, which is something that we hadn’t discussed before.
	The following stakeholders were identified:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The commuters (the target users). 
      \item The regional public transportation administrators (Länstrafiken). 
      \item The Swedish Government\footnote{Forgotten during stakeholder analysis but added during the construction of the Context diagram, see section \ref{subsec:context}}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Similar companies}
In order to get inspiration and see what similar services there are today, it can be
a good idea to look at competitors or partner’s services. This is not a technique
in itself but is often used with for example observation.

    
    \subsubsection{Application}
We decided to use the following services and combine it with an informal obser-
vation study where one person used the app and tried different features while
another one observed. We discussed the individual alternatives during the ex-
periment and compared them afterwards. The ones we looked at are:
\begin{itemize}
		\item SL app and widget (Regional in Stockholm)
		\item Västtrafik app and widget (Regional in Gothenburg)
		\item Skåetrafiken app and widget (Regional in Skåne)
		\item SJ mobile web page and app (Interregional trains Sweden)
	\end{itemize}
	
    \subsubsection{Why chosen}
We used this method to get an idea of how a finished product might look like
and to get inspiration to features to include in our solution.
    \subsubsection{Outcome}
The method helped us to develop many of our system requirements and it
generated questions that we could discuss with our costumers to get a better
final product.

    \subsection{Data model}
Data model is an abstract model of what data is needed in a system, not nec-
essarily a requirement but in our case we use the model as a requirement.
	
    \subsubsection{Application}
    We chose the user as a starting point and tried to investigate what kind of data that we would need to be able to give the functionality required.
    \subsubsection{Why chosen}
    We used it to realize which kind of data the system would need.
    \subsubsection{Outcome}
	We got a lot of definitions out of putting it together since we needed to discuss what we meant by the entities in the model (coming in a data dictionary in release 2).

    \subsection{Context diagram} \label{subsec:context}
	Picture of how the system fits in to/interacts with its inner domain. It is used to realize what systems/people directly interacts with the product.
    \subsubsection{Application}
    We chose the user as a starting point and reasoned about what the user needed to use the product for, from that we realized that the product needed to interact with a couple of systems. The we reasoned about why the government wanted the product (to increase the use of public transport) which got us to realize that they would want statistics from the system.
    \subsubsection{Why chosen}
    We wanted to get an overview of how the system interacts with the actors and who might be affected by the system.
    \subsubsection{Outcome}
	When we were discussing the context diagram we realized that we were missing a stakeholder that we did not find during the stakeholder analysis. The missing stakeholder was the government that wants to get statistics from the system. 

  \section{Future work}
  %For next release
Before the next release we want to use more elicitation techniques to extract
information from our costumers. Some of the techniques and methods we would
like to incorporate in our work:

  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Virtual Windows
  	\item Interview users
  	\item Questionnaires
  	\item Suppliers 
  \end{itemize}
 
  \section{Reflection}
  %What was successful/what was challenging
  %Example, what have we learned?
  %What could have been done differently?
  %What we have learned related to learning objectives

While working with our project we have encountered several elicitation bar-
riers. One that we noticed in particular is that the stakeholder cannot express
what they need. We have also noticed that stakeholders can have conflicting
views within themselves. Another barrier has been that our clients have sug-
gested solutions rather than expressing their needs and demands.

An obstacle we have met is that we tend to forget to use several elici-
tation techniques. It is easy to get hung up on just brainstorming. Our group
does not only have a big domain knowledge but also consists of potential end
users. This gives us a false sense of security, as we think that we ourselves
incorporate the different stakeholders’ opinios and experiences. A solution to
both these problems is to carry out different elicitation techniques and contact
different stakeholders anyway. It is important to hear everyone’s opinion, since
we know from experience that more input will yield better results.

During the initial phase of the project it has been difficult to divide the
workload. This is because we needed to be on the same page regarding several
matters. However, trying to work all eight together has resulted inefficiency.
This is something we are working with and we will try to divide the work into
smaller independent tasks. We believe that this approach will result in higher
efficiency.
