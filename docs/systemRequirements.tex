			\subsubsection{Client, Group B}
			The client, Group B, has been hired by the Swedish government to develop a system to increase the number of people that use public transport and thereby reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the goals with the project is to get statistics on how people use public transport that later can be used to improve public transportation. Group B has asked us to do the requirement specification for the system. Group B is the product owner and our main stakeholder.

			\subsubsection{Swedish Government}
			The Swedish government wants to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in the country by trying to get people to commute more. To achieve this they have hired Group B to create an application that can be used throughout all of Sweden to make it more convenient to use public transportation. We, Group D, do not  communicate with the government directly but they are the ones who have ordered the system and are therefore an important stakeholder. 

			\subsubsection{Users}
			The system is created for the Swedish government but the end users are the ones that determine the projects success. If they do not use it the purpose is lost. Therefore the users are an important stakeholder for the project.

			\subsubsection{Regional Public Transportation Administrators}
			For the system to function the timetables for every line of transportation in the different regions in Sweden need to be used. It therefore need to work together with all the different regional public transportation administrators and combine their data to be able to work across regional boundaries. This makes the regional public transportation administrators an important stakeholder.

	\section{System Purpose} % (fold)
	The purpose of the system is to make everyday travels an easier task for people using public transportation. The users of this application will have an easily accessible overview of how long it will take them to get to their favorite locations. These locations can be their work, home, the gym etcetera.
	
	
The project goal is to develop an app and/or widget where the user can see how to get to their favorite destinations in the shortest time possible. The shown travel alternatives shall be adjusted according to the current position of the user, by the starting point being set to the users geographical location.

	\subsection{The parts of the context diagram}			
		\begin{itemize}

			\item[\textbf{Swedish Government}] The part of the Government that is involved in public transport has contracted the Product Owner to create Traffic-o-meter. They have delegated the responsibility of administrating Public Transportation to Regional Public Transportation Administrators. From these administrators they get feedback of how everything is working. Traffic-o-meter will give statistics to the Government about the usage.
			\item[\textbf{User}] An individual using the system. It communicates with Traffic-o-meter by being able to manage settings and in return it get to see trips. The User uses Public Transportation for their daily travel. If the user is not satisfied with Traffic-o-meter the may turn to similar systems instead, our Competitors, and get their possible trips by looking at their timetables.
			\item[\textbf{GPS system}] The native GPS of the device or WI-FI location services. The GPS system gives information to the product about the location of a device.
			\item[\textbf{Public Transportation}] The Public Transportation is the actual means of transportation that go around transporting Users (and other people). It is administrated by the Regional Public Transportation Administrators and runs after the information in the Public Transport databases.
			\item[\textbf{PTD}] Public Transport databases contains information regarding time tables, stops, means of transport and delays. Traffic-o-meter uses this information when calculating trips. The Competitors also uses the Public Transport databases for this purpose. Public Transport databases store information about when public transportation is supposed to leave, and the databases are updated if the Public Transportation is for example delayed. The databases are updated by the Regional Public Transportation Administrators.
			\item[\textbf{RPTA}] The Regional Public Transportation administrators have been given the responsibility to handle Public Transport, in a specific part of Sweden, by the government. They administrate Public Transportation and get maintenance requests from them. They create and update the Public Transport databases and analyse the data in them to improve the timetables in the future.
			
			\item[\textbf{Traffic-o-meter}] Trafic-o-meter is the product being developed. It gets its positioning data from available GPS systems. It is developed and maintained by the Product Owner. The product gives the Government statistics of its usage. It gets information about times, stops and means of transport from the Public Transport databases. Traffic-o-meter communicates with the user by showing its trips and destinations. The User can also add or manage its settings.
			\item[\textbf{Product Owner}] The Product Owner is responsible for  developing Traffic-o-meter. The product owner will also maintain the product after its release. They have been contracted to do this by the Swedish government.		
			\item[\textbf{Competitors}] Similar systems, the Competitors, compete for the Users. They are another opportunity for the user to see possible trips. They use the same Public Transport databases as Traffic-o-meter.

		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item It is important to consider how much information about the users (GPS-coordinates etc) is shared with the government.	All data should anonymous and each so that it is never possible to trace data to a person.
  			\item People will use the service every day and if the uptime is low, it will cause irritation among the users as well as bad publicity.
  			\item If the software does not have high usability, it will defeat its purpose and will not be fast and easy to use. This is one of the competitive advantages of the system.
  			\item It should be fast and easy to get travel information updates. For example if a bus is early, the user should be notified so that the user do not miss it.
  			\item Our clients explicitly said they did not want any further development of the service. However, the service should still be possible to update but it does not for example need support for extension.
  			\item It was important of our clients for the service to work on several platforms. We also have feature requirements for the platforms the service should support.
  			\item Different stakeholders might want statistics in different forms.
  			\item The service is quite specific and also our main stakeholder made it clear that the re-usability is very unimportant.

		When we performed the release planning we excluded the prioritation from the Customer (Cust) as their prioritation was done with a different method than the prioritation done by the User and the Goverments. This means that the prioritations were not compatible with eachother.
