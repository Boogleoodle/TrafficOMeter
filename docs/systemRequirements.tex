		\label{sub:stakeholders}
			\subsubsection{Client, Group B}
			The client, Group B, has been hired by the Swedish government to develop a system to increase the number of people that use public transport and thereby reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the goals with the project is to get statistics on how people use public transport that later can be used to improve public transportation. Group B has asked us to do the requirement specification for the system. Group B is the product owner and our main stakeholder.

			\subsubsection{Swedish Government}
			The Swedish government wants to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in the country by trying to get people to commute more. To achieve this they have hired Group B to create an application that can be used throughout all of Sweden to make it more convenient to use public transportation. We, Group D, do not  communicate with the government directly but they are the ones who have ordered the system and are therefore an important stakeholder. 

			\subsubsection{Users}
			The system is created for the Swedish government but the end users are the ones that determine the projects success. If they do not use it the purpose is lost. Therefore the users are an important stakeholder for the project.

			\subsubsection{Regional Public Transportation Administrators}
			For the system to function the timetables for every line of transportation in the different regions in Sweden need to be used. It therefore need to work together with all the different regional public transportation administrators and combine their data to be able to work across regional boundaries. This makes the regional public transportation administrators an important stakeholder.

	\section{System Purpose} % (fold)
	The purpose of the system is to make everyday travels an easier task for people using public transportation. The users of this application will have an easily accessible overview of how long it will take them to get to their favourite locations. These locations can be their work, home, the gym etc.
	
	
The project goal is to develop an app and/or widget where the user can see how to get to their favorite destinations in the shortest time possible. The shown travel alternatives shall be adjusted according to the current position of the user, by the starting point being set to the users geographical location.

				\item[\textbf{Stops}] The geographical positions where it is possible to get on and off public transport.
				\item[\textbf{GiveTimes}] The time table for the routes included in the updated trips.
				\item[\textbf{MeansOfTransport}] The means of transportations that are represented in the updates trips.

		\end{table}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item It is important to consider how much information about the users (GPS-coordinates etc) is shared with the government.	All data should anonymous and each so that it is never possible to trace data to a person.
  			\item People will use the service every day and if the uptime is low, it will cause irritation among the users as well as bad publicity.
  			\item If the software does not have high usability, it will defeat its purpose and will not be fast and easy to use. This is one of the competitive advantages of the system.
  			\item It should be fast and easy to get travel information updates. For example if a bus is early, the user should be notified so that the user do not miss it.
  			\item Our clients explicitly said they did not want any further development of the service. However, the service should still be possible to update but it does not for example need support for extension.
  			\item It was important of our clients for the service to work on several platforms. We also have feature requirements for the platforms the service should support.
  			\item Different stakeholders might want statistics in different forms.
  			\item The service is quite specific and also our main stakeholder made it clear that the re-usability is very unimportant.
