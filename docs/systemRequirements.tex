	\section{System Purpose} % (fold)
	The purpose of the system is to make everyday travels an easier task for people using public transportation. The users of this application will have an easily accessible overview of how long it will take them to get to their favourite locations. These locations can be their work, home, the gym etc.
	
	
The project goal is to develop an app and/or widget where the user can see how to get to their favorite destinations in the shortest time possible. The shown travel alternatives shall be adjusted according to the current position of the user, by the starting point being set to the users geographical location.

			\item[GPS system] The native GPS of the device or WI-FI location services.
			\item[RPTD] Regional public transport databases, provides information regarding time tables and delays.
			\item[TrafficOmeter] This is the product.

			\subsubsection{Traffic information} % (fold)
			\label{ssub:traffic_information}
			This section covers the different traffic information that is sent from the regional public transport databases to the TrafficOmeter system.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[Stops] The geographical positions where it is possible to get on and off public transport.
				\item[GiveTimes] The time table for the routes included in the updated trips.
				\item[MeansOfTransport] The means of transportations that are represented in the updates trips.

		When it comes to quality we consider the issues prioritized in the following way. Below are also explanations to all quality requirements we consider more or less important than as usual.

		\end{tabular}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item It is important to consider how much information about the users (GPS-coordinates etc) is shared with the government.	All data should anonymous and each so that it is never possible to trace data to a person.
  			\item People will use the service every day and if the uptime is low, it will cause irritation among the users as well as bad publicity.
  			\item If the software does not have high usability, it will defeat its purpose and won't be fast and easy to use. This is one of the competitive advantages of the system.
  			\item It should be fast and easy to get travel information updates. For example if a bus is early, the user should be notified so he/she don't miss it.
  			\item Our clients explicitly said they didn't want any further development of the service. However, the service should still be possible to update but it doesn't for example need support for extension.
  			\item It was important of our clients for the service to work on several platforms. We also have feature requirements for the platforms the service should support.
  			\item Different stakeholders might want statistics in different forms.
  			\item The service is quite specific and also our main stakeholder made it clear that the re-usability is very unimportant.
