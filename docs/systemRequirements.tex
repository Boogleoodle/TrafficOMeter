			\subsubsection{Client, Group B}
			Our client for this project is Group B that has been hired by the Swedish government to develop a system that can help gather data on how people use public transport that later can be used to improve public transport so that more people will use it and thereby reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Group B has a great developing team and are exited by the task. Unfortunately, since they are as skilled in developing as they are lost regarding requirement engineering, they do not know where to start, what to put in the system and how the system is suppose to function. This is why they have reached out to us and asked us to do the requirement specification for the system. Group B will be the product owner when we are finished with the specification and their views on the system, like as what they would as features and such, is very important to us and this makes them our main stakeholder.

			\subsubsection{Swedish Government}
			The government wants to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in the country by trying to get people to commute more. To do this they want to improve the existing public transports. As a first step they would like to gather data on where the biggest need for improvement is and on how the people are using public transport today. They know that there are some existing applications in the field, however they are only used within the different regions in Sweden and do not cover the entire country. This is why they would like to have an application or similar that can be used throughout all of Sweden that they can gather data from. However, they do not have the knowledge to create such a thing and therefore they have given Group B the task of developing this system for them. We as a team do not have any direct communication with the government but since they are the ones that ordered the system in the first place and since the idea of the system is theirs, they make for an important stakeholder for us. 

			\subsubsection{Users}
			Each day a lot of people take the bus or the train to get to where they are going. All to often the train is too crowded or one has to keep track on which bus to take and how many changes one has to make, so it is not always easy to use these means of transportation and more than once someone takes the car instead of a bus or a train. This causes a lot of unnecessary gas to get out in the atmosphere. If there only existed an easier way to use public transport so that these gases can be reduced. The system that we are doing the requirement specification for is suppose to do just that. The system might be done for the Swedish government but in the end it is the every day persons that will use it. Therefore the system has to be user friendly and very easy to use and understand. If the once that are going to use the system does not like it, they will not use it and the whole plan falls apart. To make it so that a person would use it is important and that is why the users are an important stakeholder for this project.

			\subsubsection{Regional Public Transportation Administrators}
			To be able to create this system, we have to use timetables for every line of transportation in the different regions in Sweden. We therefore has to work together with all the different regional public transportation administrators and combine their data to be able to travel across the regional boundaries in the country. This makes these an important stakeholder.

	\section{System Purpose} % (fold)
	The purpose of the system is to make everyday travels an easier task for people using public transportation. The users of this application will have an easily accessible overview of how long it will take them to get to their favourite locations. These locations can be their work, home, the gym etc.
	
	
The project goal is to develop an app and/or widget where the user can see how to get to their favorite destinations in the shortest time possible. The shown travel alternatives shall be adjusted according to the current position of the user, by the starting point being set to the users geographical location.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item[Stops] The geographical positions where it is possible to get on and off public transport.
				\item[GiveTimes] The time table for the routes included in the updated trips.
				\item[MeansOfTransport] The means of transportations that are represented in the updates trips.

		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item It is important to consider how much information about the users (GPS-coordinates etc) is shared with the government.	All data should anonymous and each so that it is never possible to trace data to a person.
  			\item People will use the service every day and if the uptime is low, it will cause irritation among the users as well as bad publicity.
  			\item If the software does not have high usability, it will defeat its purpose and won't be fast and easy to use. This is one of the competitive advantages of the system.
  			\item It should be fast and easy to get travel information updates. For example if a bus is early, the user should be notified so he/she don't miss it.
  			\item Our clients explicitly said they didn't want any further development of the service. However, the service should still be possible to update but it doesn't for example need support for extension.
  			\item It was important of our clients for the service to work on several platforms. We also have feature requirements for the platforms the service should support.
  			\item Different stakeholders might want statistics in different forms.
  			\item The service is quite specific and also our main stakeholder made it clear that the re-usability is very unimportant.
